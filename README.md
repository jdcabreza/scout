# 🗒️ Scout: A Terminal-Based Planning Assistant

Scout is a personal planning assistant to help you, well, plan from your terminal.

This is more of a playground for me to build an LLM-powered tool as a way to understand better how to they work and how to engineer them.

## Roadmap

**v0.1: The Basics**

- [ ] Accept daily prompt input
- [ ] Send prompt to Ollama -> return plan
- [ ] Save plan as... something
- [ ] Basic CLI UX

## Getting Started

Coming soon!
